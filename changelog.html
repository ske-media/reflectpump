Over the past year, a lot of our time has gone into rewriting the entire frontend codebase to be powered by SQLite. We quietly launched this across iOS, web, and macOS desktop over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>In short you should see much faster load times, and we should handle massive note collections without issue (no more reloading issues on mobile!).</p>
<p>Also included in this release is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Claude Sonnet 3.7 support for our AI assistant</li>
<li>An in-line PDF preview that lets you view PDFs within the macOS app</li>
<li>Persistent search results</li>
</ol>

<p>Reflect has added an in-line voice transcriber that lets you add voice transcriptions anywhere within your notes.</p>
<p>To use it on Mac, either press the Option key twice or Option + Space and start speaking. On Windows computers use the Alt key twice or Alt + Space. Make sure your cursor is where you want the text to go! The transcription will happen in real-time as you speak. When you’re done speaking, just use the same shortcut again.</p>
<p>We’ve started using Gemini to power our AI chat feature that lets you chat with your notes.</p>
<p>Gemini has a context limit of 2 million tokens vs. the 128k cap from OpenAI and Anthropic. This means it can take in a LOT more of your notes as context for the chat, which drastically improves the results.</p>

We’ve also improved how image resizing and uploading works.</p>
<p>OCR (“Optical Character Recognition”) extracts text from images. In Reflect, this means that the text contained in images and PDFs now shows up in the search results.</p>
<p>For example, you can take a photo of a receipt and save it to your daily note. If you search for that charge later, it will show up.

<p>Assets you save to Reflect are now end-to-end encrypted. That means any image or file you add to a note can only be decrypted and viewed by you.</p>
<p>We’ve also added a lock screen activity widget for our voice transcriber. When you record a voice note from Reflect’s iOS app, it now shows the recording activity from your lock screen. There’s also a convenient “Stop” button for when you’re finished.</p>
<p>Next we’ve added deep links, which allow you to open specific pages or notes within Reflect, directly from external applications. Jump straight to the exact note or page you need, saving time and reducing clicks.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve added a few improvements to images. Images are now available to save and view while offline. Like the rest of your notes, they will sync once you go back online again.</p>
<p>On iOS you can now also zoom into images after clicking them to expand.</p>

<p>Our tasks manager is designed to be a simple aggregation of the tasks across your notes. You can create new tasks, check-off completed ones, and schedule tasks for the future.</p>
<p>Our goal isn't to build a fully fledged task manager (we recommend other great apps like Things for that), but we decided to add a basic aggregate view so tasks don’t get buried in your daily notes.</p>
<p>If you don't see the Tasks tab at the bottom, update the Reflect iPhone app.</p>

<p>The one exception is when you are using Reflect in Safari, so we’ve also added the ability to manually select the layout in your preferences.</p>
<p>💡Tip: click on the question mark next to your profile name in the lower left corner of the app, then click “Keyboard shortcuts”. Here you’ll be able to see what the custom shortcuts are for your language.</p>

<p>Reflect’s iPhone app has been out of beta for quite a while, but has remained in TestFlight (Apple’s developer platform), until now.</p>
<p>The app is functionally the same as the TestFlight app, but we recommend uninstalling the old app and downloading the new one from the App Store. This is where future updates will be made.</p>
<p>You can download Reflect from the App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reflect-notes/id1575595407">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Today we are releasing</strong> <a href="index.html">Reflect 2</a><strong>.</strong> We have made improvements across the board from templates, to history revisions, to pretty redesigns, and so much more.</p>
<p>Let's explore what's new.</p>
<h1>Templates</h1>
<p>Templates are a long requested feature. They make it easy to insert commonly used snippets. For example, you might want to use a common structure for your daily note.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fbe0c6432339e49d7a6fcbdfa6af52740?alt=media&amp;token=c9b6ba70-9c8d-4f0b-899c-c8dfcbec991e" alt=""></p>
<p>You can edit templates under Reflect's preferences. And insert using our new slash menu. Just type forward-slash, the template name, and then enter.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fc833495cecce46f599565957039509c9?alt=media&amp;token=e9473084-2eae-45e4-9b6e-ab9c2984afca" alt=""></p>
<p>Which is a great segue to our other editor improvements...</p>
<h1>Editor polishing</h1>
<p>Our goal with the editor is to make it fast and invisible. Its power should blend into the background. If we do our job right you should enter a state of flow while using it.</p>
<p>We started out by creating a new 'slash menu' for editing your notes.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F5ceb9b5b163b4948ae0e6c503fef79d3?alt=media&amp;token=28bfc8c6-c3a7-40fc-a2fe-6f97887a9939" alt=""></p>
<p>We added a text-selection popup menu to make formatting easier.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fa657b03a3721425bafaa68715d1b3003?alt=media&amp;token=721fbf81-004e-4fac-b820-115cd151ebdb" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we added a few tools around link-editing. You can now hover a link to see its url and a quick edit menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F87976b5404dc4b91a44a3f55d079a53f?alt=media&amp;token=7268e960-4af2-4963-a58e-0869d4ab0216" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also press press <code>cmd k</code> over selected text to quickly link it.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F9ceab00dbbde49abb31b1ae252d56a6b?alt=media&amp;token=ad732b01-8941-4aa5-a415-1ff96361420b" alt=""></p>
<h1><strong>History browser and sync</strong></h1>
<p>Behind the blinking cursor on every Reflect note lies an incredible amount of complexity. From the rich-text editor, to the realtime sync, to the end-to-end encryption... it turns out note-taking is one of the harder problems in computer science.</p>
<p>And the grand-daddy of all these problems: merging offline changes. In Reflect 2 we have rewritten our sync engine to use <a href="https://yjs.dev/">YJS</a>, the gold-standard in the space. What this means in practice is that your offline changes will be merged in a more intelligent manner.</p>
<p>As part of this update we've released our History Browser. This is like a time-machine for your notes. You can view all of your changes to a note and revert to any point in time.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F51156b36cb3949fb858a549ed75e8ee0?alt=media&amp;token=f5544387-b03c-4bbf-b6aa-d155dd7f4248" alt=""></p>
<h1>Brainier <strong>Brain</strong></h1>
<p>Our Brain tab is both a fun way to visualize all your notes and a useful way of explaining <em>&quot;what the hell is a graph database is and why are you spending so much time on it&quot;</em> to your partner.</p>
<p>In Reflect 2.0 we've touched up the interface a bit and color-coded your notes based on tag. We've added a few filters so you can exclude your daily notes, for example.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fae14b9c77b3f4fc287fdbd01531763ae?alt=media&amp;token=7b3d2687-fd54-480e-8f5d-90bcea646f93" alt=""></p>
<h1><strong>Meeting tweaks</strong></h1>
<p>The less typing you have to do the better. That's why we make it super easy to import meetings from your calendar straight into your daily notes.</p>
<p>In Reflect 2.0 you can now import more events from multiple calendars. Also, if you edit an attendee's name we'll remember that in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F1de58943e5eb4034a4832fe8bce1d268?alt=media&amp;token=36b52186-7b27-4cb8-924a-53a77c5c75f1" alt=""></p>
<h1><strong>Date styling</strong></h1>
<p>We know our users have different preferences around date and time formats. In Reflect's settings you can now specify which format you want.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F9647fc5e145746a9b1a4495eb2fd479a?alt=media&amp;token=ecc3cf11-5011-4f83-bba8-68e7f77a427a" alt=""></p>
<p>We have also added a little shortcut for inserting the current time.<br>
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F2f8fedbf7a864042949fb035fb7ed0e3?alt=media&amp;token=7b4cb990-4b55-4554-964e-603789e3a0e6" alt=""></p>
<h1><strong>Design facelift</strong></h1>
<p>We have redesigned the nav bar and split up the <em>account</em> and <em>support</em> popup menus.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fa85953253ebc4e4d87ffd9b8bd5181ed?alt=media&amp;token=24d2b806-7230-4c7a-ab2e-7f3fd2e5c605" alt=""></p>
<p>For those of you who like creating multiple graphs we have added a little color setting so you can easily see which area you're in.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F7beec62047b44a1a86b740c5c1a109c6?alt=media&amp;token=f26306fb-dbb0-497e-968d-4011959cea98" alt=""></p>
<h1>And so much more...</h1>
<p>There are hundreds of tiny improvements and bug fixes that didn't make these release notes (like markdown exports). I'm proud of the progress our little team has made. If you want to see how the sausage is made, <a href="http://reflect.app/discord">join our discord</a>.</p>

They make it easy to insert commonly used snippets. For example, you might want to use a common structure for your daily note.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fbe0c6432339e49d7a6fcbdfa6af52740?alt=media\u0026token=c9b6ba70-9c8d-4f0b-899c-c8dfcbec991e)\n\nYou can edit templates under Reflect's preferences. And insert using our new slash menu. Just type forward-slash, the template name, and then enter.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fc833495cecce46f599565957039509c9?alt=media\u0026token=e9473084-2eae-45e4-9b6e-ab9c2984afca)\n\nWhich is a great segue to our other editor improvements...\n\n# Editor polishing\n\nOur goal with the editor is to make it fast and invisible. Its power should blend into the background. If we do our job right you should enter a state of flow while using it.\n\nWe started out by creating a new 'slash menu' for editing your notes.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F5ceb9b5b163b4948ae0e6c503fef79d3?alt=media\u0026token=28bfc8c6-c3a7-40fc-a2fe-6f97887a9939)\n\nWe added a text-selection popup menu to make formatting easier.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fa657b03a3721425bafaa68715d1b3003?alt=media\u0026token=721fbf81-004e-4fac-b820-115cd151ebdb)\n\nThen we added a few tools around link-editing. You can now hover a link to see its url and a quick edit menu.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F87976b5404dc4b91a44a3f55d079a53f?alt=media\u0026token=7268e960-4af2-4963-a58e-0869d4ab0216)\n\nYou can also press press `cmd k` over selected text to quickly link it.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F9ceab00dbbde49abb31b1ae252d56a6b?alt=media\u0026token=ad732b01-8941-4aa5-a415-1ff96361420b)\n\n# **History browser and sync**\n\nBehind the blinking cursor on every Reflect note lies an incredible amount of complexity. From the rich-text editor, to the realtime sync, to the end-to-end encryption... it turns out note-taking is one of the harder problems in computer science.\n\nAnd the grand-daddy of all these problems: merging offline changes. In Reflect 2 we have rewritten our sync engine to use [YJS](https://yjs.dev/), the gold-standard in the space. What this means in practice is that your offline changes will be merged in a more intelligent manner.\n\nAs part of this update we've released our History Browser. This is like a time-machine for your notes. You can view all of your changes to a note and revert to any point in time.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F51156b36cb3949fb858a549ed75e8ee0?alt=media\u0026token=f5544387-b03c-4bbf-b6aa-d155dd7f4248)\n\n# Brainier **Brain**\n\nOur Brain tab is both a fun way to visualize all your notes and a useful way of explaining _\"what the hell is a graph database is and why are you spending so much time on it\"_ to your partner.\n\nIn Reflect 2.0 we've touched up the interface a bit and color-coded your notes based on tag. We've added a few filters so you can exclude your daily notes, for example.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2Fae14b9c77b3f4fc287fdbd01531763ae?alt=media\u0026token=7b3d2687-fd54-480e-8f5d-90bcea646f93)\n\n# **Meeting tweaks**\n\nThe less typing you have to do the better. That's why we make it super easy to import meetings from your calendar straight into your daily notes.\n\nIn Reflect 2.0 you can now import more events from multiple calendars. Also, if you edit an attendee's name we'll remember that in the future.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FgjzQZB390LOY9DmlguxzrU6xaHw2%2F1de58943e5eb4034a4832fe8bce1d268?alt=media\u0026token=36b52186-7b27-4cb8-924a-53a77c5c75f1)\n\n# **Date styling**\n\nWe know our users have different preferences around date and time formats.
